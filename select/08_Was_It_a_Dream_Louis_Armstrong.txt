I'm in a trance, a beautiful trance
Since I fell in love with you
I can't believe it happened at all
It seems too good to be true

Was it a dream? Was it a dream?
We were alone and you were in my arms last night
Was it a dream? Was it a dream?
We made a vow beneath the pale moonlight

I never knew, I never thought
Such bliss as this could fill me with a love divine
I'm afraid I'll wake and find it was only in my mind
Was it a dream or are you really mine?

I never knew, I never thought
Such bliss as this could fill me with a love divine
I'm afraid I'll wake and find it was only in my mind
Was it a dream or are you really mine?
